# Reddit gender classification
---

## Purpose

  The purpose of this project is to correctly classify the gender of some Reddit users based 
  only on their comments ( so the data will contain the date of the comments, the
  subreddit which they belong and the comment itself)

---           

## Contents 

  - Main project ( Reddit gender classification.ipynb) 

---

## Usage

  The main file contains a pre-processing pipeline using dummy encoding for categorical features (subreddits)
  and a simple TF-IDF encoding process, while the date features are not really relevant so they are not considered
  in the process. After downloading the main file, run it while considering different parameters for the
  pipeline above described.
  The data for both train and test could be found at [Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/datamining2022/data),
  along with a brief explanation.
